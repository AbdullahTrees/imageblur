# ImageBlur Chrome Extension (AbdullahTrees Archival copy)
This plugin blurs out images in <img> tags on the current web page. If you hover over an image for 1 second, the image will be revealed. Features include: blur/unblur images by default, a blur images button, and an "unblur" images button.

## DISCLAIMER
I(AbdullahTrees) intend to work on this plugin and modify it so that it is more powerful and better someday. For this reason I am making a copy of this code, just in case...

### Featues I would like to add:
I anticipate adding a better icon, functionality to blur background images, "right-click" option to unblur or blur a specific images on a page and the ability to whitelist and blacklist specific pages/sites.
